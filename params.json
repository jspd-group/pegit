In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\r\n\r\n## Need and Requirement\r\nAs a part of their course plan/scheme students of computer science\r\nbranch are required to make coding projects may it be in any language C, C++,\r\nJava, Python, HTML and so on. What the usual practice is, they make files\r\nnamely(.c ,.h, .py, .html ...), or ReadMe files and various directories.\r\nThey make single source code file and make all the changes in it and save it.\r\nWhat happens in this practice is that they keep on losing the original code\r\nand data. After making many additions and after editing the source code so many\r\ntimes, say, one encounters a bug (a software bug is an error, flaw, failure or\r\nfault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or\r\nunexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways), it is very difficult to\r\ntrace the bug, meaning, it is very difficult to trace the part of the code which\r\nis responsible for the unexpected behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Manual Solution\r\nPossible solution can be cloning the whole source code each time before making\r\neven a minute change. This takes too much of users time (as code becomes larger)\r\nand also has memory limitation. There is repetition of those files too in which\r\nno change was made.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Automated Solution (Version Control System)\r\nVersion control system is an automated system which keeps tracks of all the\r\nchanges in the repository of the project. System makes use of computer\r\nprocessing and uses database to know which files have been edited, deleted or\r\nnewly created. When changes are made, the system will ask the developer if they\r\nare to be committed(saved). Developer can give command to the system to save\r\nthem. Developer can retrieve any previous version of the project by accessing\r\nthe database. If developer makes a mistake, he can roll back to a previous\r\nversion. He can reproduce and understand a bug report on a past version of the\r\nproject's source code. He can also undo specific edits without losing all the\r\nwork that was done in the meanwhile. For any part of a file, he can determine\r\nwhen and why it was ever edited.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 1st Stage\r\nAll the information mentioned above will constitute the first stage of our\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2nd Stage\r\nIn the second stage of this project we will introduce networking concepts into\r\nour project. Multiple users can work on same project. And it will enable\r\nmultiple people to simultaneously work on a single project. Each person edits\r\nhis or her own copy of the files and chooses when to share those changes with\r\nthe rest of the team. Thus, temporary or partial edits by one person do not\r\ninterfere with another person's work. It will also enable one person to use\r\nmultiple computers to work on a project. It will be able to integrate work done\r\nsimultaneously by different team members. In most cases, edits to different\r\nfiles or even the same file will be combined without losing any work. In rare\r\ncases, when two people make conflicting edits to the same line of a file, then\r\nit will request human assistance in deciding what to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3rd Stage\r\nIn the third stage, we will introduce graphical user interface into our project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
